There are many schools and colleges that take frequent exams and 
creating a perfect balanced paper for all these exams are a difficult task.
Most of the teachers already have a long question bank for the courses he 
is teaching. So, we are providing a system where s/he can generate a random
paper with constraints specified by him/her. We currently support four such 
constraints:
1. Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
2. Cognitive level (Application, Knowledge, Comprehension)
3. Unit wise mark distribution 
4. Question Type (Subjective, Objective)

We also store all previously generated papers so that teacher can access it 
anytime. We by default don't ask previously asked question. We also provide
an option to email generated paper in PDF format to the examiner.
